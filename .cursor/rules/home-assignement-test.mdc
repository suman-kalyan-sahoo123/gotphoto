# Senior Data Platform Engineer - Home Assignment Rules

## dbt Project Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Keep transformations simple and readable
- Add clear, concise comments explaining business logic
- Use descriptive model and column names
- Follow dbt naming conventions (staging_, intermediate_, mart_)
- never use select * always use column names

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- Handle NULL values explicitly in transformations
- Add data quality tests for critical fields
- Consider timezone differences in date calculations
- Validate data types and ranges
- Test for empty datasets and missing sources

### Best Practices
- Use generic dbt tests (unique, not_null, accepted_values)
- Create custom tests for business rules
- Document models with descriptions and column definitions
- Use macros for reusable logic
- Implement incremental models for large datasets
- Add source freshness checks

### Docker & Infrastructure
- Use non-root user for security
- Mount volumes for development workflow
- Keep container lightweight and focused
- Handle connection failures gracefully
- Use environment variables for configuration

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual models
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Data quality assertions at each layer
- Performance testing for large transformations
- Edge case validation (empty data, duplicates, invalid formats)
